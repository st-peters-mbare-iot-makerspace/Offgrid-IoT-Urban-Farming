# üå± Off-Grid IoT Urban Farming

## Overview
Off-Grid IoT Urban Farming is a community-driven initiative that demonstrates how **low-cost IoT, open-source technologies, and aquaponics** can be combined to tackle food insecurity in underserved urban areas.  

The project explores how sensors, microcontrollers, and edge devices can create a **self-sustaining, reproducible farming model** that reduces resource use, improves yields, and empowers communities.

## Why This Project?
Urban communities in Zimbabwe (and many other regions) face overlapping challenges:  
- Limited access to affordable fresh food  
- Poor sanitation and recurring disease outbreaks  
- Scarce water and land resources  
- Limited exposure to practical, emerging technologies  

By leveraging **aquaponics** and **open IoT systems**, this project aims to turn these constraints into opportunities for **food security, sustainability, and skills development**.

## Aquaponics in Action
Aquaponics combines **aquaculture (raising fish)** with **hydroponics (growing plants in water)** to form a circular ecosystem:
- Fish waste provides natural fertilizer for plants.  
- Plants filter and clean the water, which is recirculated back to the fish.  
- IoT sensors and actuators regulate and optimize the system.  

Our implementation uses **1000L IBC totes** as growing units. These systems are:  
- **Low-cost and reproducible** ‚Äî built with accessible materials  
- **Efficient** ‚Äî up to 90% less water than conventional farming  
- **Chemical-free** ‚Äî no pesticides, closed system  
- **Resilient** ‚Äî off-season vegetable growth enabled through climate control
